18. Preprocessing - produces equivalent .c code sans comments
    Compiling - turns output of preprocessed code to assembly
    Assembling - turns assembly output to machine-level binary
    Linking - produces executable

19. main is of type int. It returns an int based on the success of the termination

21. a) i+j=140
    b) i+k=4
    c) j+k=24

22. a) 0.00
    b) 0.67
    c) 0.00
    d) 3
    e) 3
    f) 3.00

27. 1) trace the route the input takes, follow it until it's too convoluted
    2) trace backwards; follow where each variable came from starting with the output/print statement
    3) comment out chunks. work with small bits of code with known inputs/outputs.
       see if anything changes when chunks are commented out.
    4) while commenting, work to modularize the code more; make it less monolithic

28. see code

30. a) 3
    b) 4
    c) 2
    d) 6
    e) error
    f) -679072640
    g) 2

31. i = 5
    (5>1) resolves to 1; 3 * 1 = 3
    (k=2) resolves to 2; 3 + 2 = 5
    (k==6) resolves to 1, but is boolean. total remains 5.

32. a) 00FF
    b) 0000
    c) 0003
    d) 0003
    e) 0000
    f) 0000
    g) 0000

34. see ascii.c and ascii_output

35. see vid
