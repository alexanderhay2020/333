open loop control
  guessing/calculating effort

feedback control
  sense and affect, sensor determines effort

  PID - proportional, integral, derivative control
    P - effort proportional to error
    I - effort proportional to duration of error (thermal dump)
    D - effort proportional to rate of change of error

  Effort is control signal (u)

  u(t) = Kp*e(t) + Ki*integral(e(z),0,t) + Kd * e_dot(t)

  e_dot = (e_now - e_previous)/dt

  derivative amplifies noise

  Kp - determines rise & settling time
       maintains/sets energy of system
  Kd - reduce overshoot and oscillation
       removes energy from system
  Ki - makes steady state error to zero (potentially unstable)
       adds energy to system

  rise time ----- time system takes to reach target
  settling time - time system takes to stabilize

  Add/tune Kp first to get rise time
  Add/tune Kd to limit overshoot/oscillation, tune until rise time is achieved again
  Add/tune Ki until SS_error is zero
