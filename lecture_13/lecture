setup Timer2 for 100Hz int

PR2 = ?           // want to maximize
TCKPS = ?         // need to sort of guess
if TCKPS = div by 1, PR2 is 800,000 pulses. doesn't work because 800,000 > 65535
(page 135 or 155, can't see)

set TCKPS to 256
PR2 then is 3,125 which is smaller than 65535



PR2 = 3,125
TMR2 = 0
T2CONbits.TCKPS = 0b111
T2CONbits.ON = 1
