Defines input/output
TRIS - Output -> 0
       Input  -> 1

TRISD = 0
TRISDbits.TRISD0 = 0
TRISCLR = 0b00...01
  (make any 1 bits into 0's)


If output (TRISD = 0)
LAT (latch)
  when set to 1, it will stay 1 forever (until changed)

To look at port
if(PORTDbits.RD0){
  yada
  }


Delay function using core timer
Core Timer - unsigned 32bit int
  - adds 1 every other sysclk
  - 40MHz clock (80MHz/2)

_CP0_ SET_COUNT(0)
while (_CP0_GET_COUNT() < 20,000,000){    (20 million is 0.5 seconds)
  yada
}

107 secs is the longest it can time without rolling over

Trade off between resolution and length of time
(can use peripheral clocks at slower frequency but you lose resolution)
